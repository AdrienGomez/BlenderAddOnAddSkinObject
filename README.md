Blender Add-On Add Skin Object

What is This Add-on?

This is a very simple Add-On from someone who is not a dev!

I allows to Add an object with only one vertex and two modifiers, Skin and Subdivision. I wrote it to quickly create base mesh to sculpt.
Intall

How to use it.

Once the add-on is installed and enabled, just go to the Add menu in the 3D view then Mesh and you'll find the Add Skin Object. 
You can also use the default shortcut Shit + A to open the Add menu in the 3D view. 
The object has only one vertex. to add more vertices, you need to go into Edit Mode the press E to extrude more vertex and egdes.
